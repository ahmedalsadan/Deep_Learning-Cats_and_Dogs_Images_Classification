# Cats and Dogs Images Classification

## Backstory
In deep learning, an artificial neural network uses the processing of a brain as a basis to develop algorithms that can be used to model complex patterns and prediction problems,
this network is what needed to recognize an image whether for a cat or dog.

## Data
The dataset has been downloaded from this Kaggle website [link](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset). 
It has 25000 images distributed equally for the two classes which are dog and cat, that indicates that it is balanced.
