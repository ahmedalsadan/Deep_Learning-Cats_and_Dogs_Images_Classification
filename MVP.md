# Cats and Dogs Images Classification
## Goal
To predict the class of an image whether a cat or dog by building and training a convolution neural network and using a sigmoid function.
## Dataset
The dataset has 25000 images and 2 classes which are dog and cat, each of the two classes has 12500 images which indicates that the dataset is balanced, as shown below.

The model has been built and fit with 5 epoches, and its accuracy improved gradually until the training and validation accuracies reached the fifth epoch 
with 0.9585 and 0.9704, respectively. Also, the testing accuracy reached 0.970353 which is excellent, as shown below
